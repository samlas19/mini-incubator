# Mini-Incubator – Portable Lactate Analyzer

This repository presents a prototype project of a portable biomedical device designed for rapid blood lactate analysis in field conditions (military / emergency use).

## Project Overview
The device combines:
- A controlled incubation chamber
- Optical lactate strip reading
- Risk classification (NORMAL / ALERT / CRITICAL)
- Modular design (future glucose expansion)

This project is currently at prototype and simulation level.
